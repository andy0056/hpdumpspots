# DumpSpot

A civic reporting tool for public hazards. See garbage, sewage overflow, road encroachment, burning waste, debris — pin it on the map. No account, no login. A name, a location, a photo.

Built for India, works anywhere.

## What it does

Anyone can open DumpSpot and file a report in under a minute. Reports appear live on a shared map. Every pin is a real location with photos, coordinates, and a timestamp. The more reports, the more pressure on civic bodies to act.

No accounts. No bureaucracy. Just evidence.

## How it's built

No framework. No build step. Three files that run directly in a browser.

- `index.html` — all markup, page structure, script imports
- `style.css` — all styles, design tokens, layout, components
- `app.js` — all logic: map, list, form, upload, submit, spam checks, location encoding
- `config.js` — credentials only, gitignored, never pushed
- `build.js` — Node script run at deploy time, generates `config.js` from env vars
- `netlify.toml` — one line: `node build.js`
- `favicon.svg` — fairy with a trash bag

Everything loads from CDN. No npm, no bundler, no local install required.

---

## Running locally

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
# or
npx serve .
```

Open `http://localhost:8080`. Make sure `config.js` has your real credentials.

---

## Deploying

1. Push `index.html`, `style.css`, `app.js`, `build.js`, `netlify.toml`, `favicon.svg` to GitHub
2. Connect repo to Netlify
3. Set environment variables in Netlify → Site settings → Environment variables:
   - `DB_URL` — your database project URL
   - `DB_KEY` — your publishable API key
   - `LOCK_INSPECT_ENV` — `true` (disables devtools on production)
4. Deploy — Netlify runs `node build.js`, generates `config.js`, serves the site

## Report ID

Every report gets `DS-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-XXXX` — date, time, 4-char hex. Immutable after creation. Shown on success screen and detail page.

## What's not built yet

- No authentication — reporter name is a plain text field [not required at the moment]
- No moderation dashboard or report flagging
- No map clustering for dense report areas
- No editing or deleting reports after submit
- No push notifications for new reports near a location
